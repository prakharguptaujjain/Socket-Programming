[TEST1] [✓]: For server 1, we will start a single client, connect to server, and test all 4
  arithmetic operations (+,-,*,/) with two operands each. We will check that the
  results returned by the server to the client are correct.
  
[TEST2] [✓]: For server1, we will start a client, do some math operations (like TEST1), then
  terminate the client, start a second client, and check that the second client can chat with
  the server as well.
  
[TEST3] [✓]: For server 1, we will try to connect a second client when the first one is still
  connected, and check that its socket operations fail.
  
[TEST4] [✓]: For server 2, we will check the correctness of arithmetic operations for a single
  client, as in TEST1.
  
[TEST5] [✓]: For server2, we will test that multiple clients can simultaneously connect and
  chat with the server correctly.
  
[TEST6] [✓]: For server2, we will connect a client, then connect and disconnect a second
  client. The first client should continue to function correctly.
  
[TEST7] [✓]: We will test that server2 starts multiple processes for multiple clients.
